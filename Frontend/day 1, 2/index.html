                    <p>Dear Mr. Doe</p>
                    <p>
                        I am writing you concerning a recent purchase of widgets.
                        Approximately two weeks ago, on October 1, I ordered a total of 50 widgets for Company, Inc. via the Widgets Galore client webpage. 
                        I received an email notification two days later confirming the receipt of payment and the shipment of the widgets. 
                        According to your website, shipments should reach their destination within 3-5 business days of being sent, but I have yet to receive the widgets. 
                        Do you have any information on what may have happened to delay the shipment or where the shipment is currently?
                    </p>

                        I have worked with Widgets Galore, Inc. in the past and have the greatest confidence in your products and customer service. 
                        We need the shipment of widgets soon, however, and I hoped you might be able to provide me with an idea of when I can expect them. 
                        Thank you in advance for any help you might be able to offer.
